MulDeMu version 0.1.1

by sephiroth99

This program demultiplexes Tomb Raider "mul" files. Mul files are used in
Crystal Dynamics' Tomb Raider games (TRL, TRA, TRU, LCGoL). MulDeMu is only
compatible with the PC version of those games.

Mul files contain audio data and sometimes, cinematic data (most likely used
for cutscenes). MulDeMu will convert the audio to a single multichannel 16-bit
PCM WAVE file, or to multiple monochannel 16-bit PCM WAVE files. If it detects
cinematic data, it will extract it in raw form. By default, cinematic data is
not extracted.

The audio conversion algorithm is based on the one in DarkFader's mul2wav. His
program crashes with some mul files containing cinematic data, so I made this
one. Also, I wanted an open-source program to convert TRU audio.


How to use:
muldemu [options] file1 [file2 ...]

You need to give at least one file to convert. You can give as many files as
you want.

Options are:
-s --split   : Write multiple mono wav files, instead of a single multichannel
               wav file.
-c --cine    : Enable cinematic data output.
-h -? --help : Help menu
