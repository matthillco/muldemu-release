MulDeMu version 0.1.0

by sephiroth99

This program demultiplexes Tomb Raider Underworld's (TRU) "mul" files.

In TRU, "mul" files contain audio data and sometimes, cinematic data (used for
cutscenes). MulDeMu will convert the audio to a single multichannel 16-bits PCM
wav file, or to multiple monochannel 16-bits PCM wav files. If it detects
cinematic data, it will extract it.

The audio conversion algorithm is based on the one in DarkFader's mul2wav. His
program crashes with some mul files containing cinematic data.


How to use:
muldemu [option] file1 [file2 ...]

You need to give at least one file to convert. You can give as many files as
you want.

Options are:
-s --split   : Write multiple mono wav files, instead of a single multichannel
               wav file.
-h -? --help : Help menu
